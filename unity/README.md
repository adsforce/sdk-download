If you want to report custom event, you should open the custom event report controller firstly.

> Note: Default custom event report controller is disable.

```java

```

Or maybe you don't need to reprot custom event, you can disable the custom reporter.

```java
AdsforceApi.enableCustomerEvent(false);
```

Depending on the type of the reported parameters, you can select one of the following three methods for reporting.

```
/**
 * Custom event report
 *
 * @param key   Key of event
 * @param value Data for reproting
 */
AdsforceApi.customerEventWithValue(string key, string value);

/**
 * Custom event report
 *
 * @param key  Key of event
 * @param list Use Arraylist for reproting
 */
AdsforceApi.customerEventWithList(string key, List<string> list);

/**
 * Custom event report
 *
 * @param key Key of event
 * @param map Use HashMap for reproting
 */
AdsforceApi.customerEventWithMap(string key, Dictionary<string, string> dic);
```
